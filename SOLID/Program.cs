	/// Design principles provide high level guidelines to design better software applications.
	/// They do not provide implementation guidelines and are not bound to any programming language.
	/// The SOLID (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP) principles are one of the most popular sets of design principles.

	/// For example, the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP) suggests that a class should have only one reason to change.
	/// This is a high-level statement which we can keep in mind while designing or creating classes for our application.
	/// SRP does not provide specific implementation steps but it's up to you how you implement SRP in your application.
